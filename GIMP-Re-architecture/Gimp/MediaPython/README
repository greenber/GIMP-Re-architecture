GENERAL STRUCTURE:
 DBUS folder contains all the files necessary to connect Gimp and DBUS.
    PDB procedure wrappings are in glim-gimpbus.c. glim-gimpbus.xml is used
    elsewhere to generate python wrappings, so that needs to be up to date and
    in agreement with the .c and .h files of the same name.

 MediaPython folder contains all the files that wrap the procedures announced
    and wrapped in the DBUS folder. This is done automatically in
    get_dbus_methods_python.py, which calls generate_from_xml.py to parse the
    XML to extract the procedure names. Procedure names are saved in
    func_list_from_xml.py. Then, get_dbus_methods_python.py announced the
    DBUS procedures to python so they can then be called and wrapped.
    They are wrapped in wrappers_*, where wrappers_intro.py contains all the
    preliminary stuff (error declarations, importations, etc). wrappers_all.py
    is generated in the Makefile by concatenating wrappers_intro and all the
    other wrappers_* files.
    mediapylib.py is what users should import in their python console. It
    imports all the wrappers so that the user can call any wrapped procedure.
    "make all" should generate all the things that need to be generated.

INSTALL:
 DBUS:
    make gimpbus
    sudo make install
 MediaPython:
    make all

RUN:
 GIMP:
    Open DBUS connection: in Filters menu, under MediaScheme, click “gimpbus”.
    This opens DBUS->GIMP connection. The connection is closed when GIMP is closed.
 Wing/other Python console:
    in Python console, type “from mediapylib import *” to import our library of MediaPython
           GIMP procedures.
