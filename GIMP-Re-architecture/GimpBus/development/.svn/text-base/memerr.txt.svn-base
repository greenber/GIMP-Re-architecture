There seems to be a memory error in GimpBus.  I think that it's been
there awhile, but it just got noticed now.  (In particular, I think it
gets identified when I allocate lots of stuff.)

It turns out that compiling with -lmcheck is not the way to go.  mcheck
doesn't do well with multi-threaded programs.

I can get gdb to run on the program by
* Setting an environment variable
	export GIMP_PLUGIN_DEBUG=gimpbus
* Starting gimp
* Starting gimpbus
* Getting the PID
* Starting gdb with
	gdb gimpbus PID
* Continuing
	continue

I can get valgrind to run on the program by
* Setting some environment variables
	export GIMP_PLUGIN_DEBUG_WRAP=gimpbus
	export GIMP_PLUGIN_DEBUG_WRAPPER=valgrind
* Starting gimp
* Starting gimpbus

Here's what I observe:
* It crashes on the 34th GIMP PDB function when no debugger is used.
* It crashes on the 34th GIMP PDB function with gdb is used.  In this case,
  I get a malloc error.
* It does not crash when valgrind is used.  Agh!
