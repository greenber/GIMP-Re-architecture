Since I'm having trouble with the sample GDBus code, I thought it would
be valuable to do a manual compile.  This directory serves that purpose.

The command is

cc -g -Wall -lmcheck `pkg-config --cflags --libs glib-2.0 gio-unix-2.0` -o gdbus-example-server gdbus-example-server.c

Finding out library info

pkg-config --modversion glib-2.0 gio-unix-2.0
