EXPERIMENTS

* E1: A simple counter [done]
* E2: A simple counter, moving common stuff to a library [done]
* E3: Alternate way of requesting names [done; decided against]
* E4: Multiple counters (aka counter factory)
* E5: Add some error stuff
* E6: Try a GIMP plug-in

PRELIMINARIES/DOCUMENTATION

It looks like the obvious D-Bus stuff is done through glib.  We need to
create an GObject of our own and write XML to attach to it.  Documentation at

  http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-tutorial.html

Good documentation (which I had not found previously) is at

  http://wiki.maemo.org/Documentation/Maemo_5_Developer_Guide/DBus/Using_GLib_Wrappers_For_D-Bus

The code seems to be at

  http://vcs.maemo.org/svn/maemoexamples/trunk/glib-dbus-sync/

NAMING SERVICES

In requesting the name, might we be better off using
dbus_bus_request_name(DBusConection *connection, const char *name, unsigned int flags, DBusError *error).  (It's simpler.)

Documentation at 

  http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/api/html/group__DBusBus.htm

Note that we can pay better attention to the flags and the results, too.

I succeeded in this strategy (revision 3932).  However, I worry that there
seems to be a mismatch between the described types of dbus_bus_request_name
and the actual types.  It also looks like the official DBus documentation
suggests sending this as a message

  http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html

So, I'm going to keep the better error checking but use the proxy.
